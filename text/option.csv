Bipartisan Policy Center package,"<p><strong>Bipartisan Policy Center package</strong> provides an annual primary insurance amount; limits spousal benefits; replaces the windfall elimination provision and government pension offset with a proportional reduction in Old-Age and Survivors Insurance benefits based on covered earnings; enhances survivor benefits; increases the progressivity of the benefit formula; increases the Social Security tax max to $195,000, the payroll tax to 13.4 percent, and the full retirement age to 69; switches to chained CPI for Old-Age and Survivors Insurance benefit cost-of-living adjustments; ends &#34claim-and-suspend&#34 games; creates a basic minimum benefit for all individuals above the full retirement age eligible for Social Security; and taxes 100 percent of Social Security benefits for single beneficiaries with annual incomes above $250,000 and married beneficiaries with annual incomes above $500,000 (thresholds are indexed by wage growth). Beginning in 2020, employers that do not currently offer a qualified retirement plan must offer employer plans (MEP) with no employer contributions and include automatic enrollment and automatic escalation from 3% to 10% of pay. Investments are made in pre-tax dollars and are taxable at withdrawal. <a href='https://urbanorg.app.box.com/folder/35503855074'>Click here for additional data.</a></p>",<p><strong>Open group unfunded obligation</strong> decreases from $11.24 trillion to,-$0.01 trillion,.</p>, <p><strong>Insolvency year</strong> increases from 2034 to,beyond 2090,.</p>,<p><strong>75 year actuarial balance</strong> improves from -2.81% to,-0.12%,.
